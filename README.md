# Stroke Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
This project develops a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient having a stroke based on a range of clinical, demographic, and lifestyle factors. The primary goal is to create a decision-support tool that can help identify at-risk individuals , enabling timely medical intervention and potentially reducing morbidity and mortality
# Project Goal
The main objective is to build a robust classification model for stroke risk. This project focuses not just on building a model, but on addressing the specific data challenges inherent in medical datasets, such as severe class imbalance and missing values.
